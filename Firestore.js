   * Set firestore settings
   * @param {Object} settings - Firestore settings
   *
   * @param {string} [settings.projectId] - The project ID from the Google Developer's Console, e.g.
   * 'grape-spaceship-123'. We will also check the environment variable
   * GCLOUD_PROJECT for your project ID.  Can be omitted in environments that
   * support {@link https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication Application
   * Default Credentials}
   *
   * @param {string} [settings.host] - The hostname to connect to
   *
   * @param {number} [settings.port] - The port to connect to
   *
   * @param {string} [settings.keyFilename] - Local file containing the Service Account credentials as downloaded from
   * the Google Developers Console. Can  be omitted in environments that
   * support {@link https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication Application
   * Default Credentials}. To configure Firestore with custom credentials, use
   * the `credentials` property to provide the `client_email` and
   * `private_key` of your service account.
   *
   * @param {{client_email?: string; private_key?: string}} [settings.credentials] - The 'client_email' and 'private_key' properties of the service account
   * to use with your Firestore project. Can be omitted in environments that
   * support {@link https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication Application
   * Default Credentials}. If your credentials are stored in a JSON file, you
   * can specify a `keyFilename` instead.
   *
   * @param {boolean} [settings.ssl] - Whether to use SSL when connecting
   *
   * @param {number} [settings.maxIdleChannels] - The maximum number of idle GRPC channels to keep. A smaller number of idle
   * channels reduces memory usage but increases request latency for clients
   * with fluctuating request rates. If set to 0, shuts down all GRPC channels
   * when the client becomes idle. Defaults to 1.
   *
   * @param {boolean} [settings.useBigInt] - Whether to use `BigInt` for integer types when deserializing Firestore
   * Documents. Regardless of magnitude, all integer values are returned as
   * `BigInt` to match the precision of the Firestore backend. Floating point
   * numbers continue to use JavaScript's `number` type.
   *
   * @param {boolean} [settings.ignoreUndefinedProperties] - Whether to skip nested properties that are set to `undefined` during
   * object serialization. If set to `true`, these properties are skipped
   * and not written to Firestore. If set `false` or omitted, the SDK throws
   * an exception when it encounters properties of type `undefined`.
